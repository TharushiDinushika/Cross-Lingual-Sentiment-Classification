# Zero-Shot-Multilingual-Sentiment-Classification
This project implements a zero-shot multilingual sentiment classification model using the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder (mUSE) and the Yelp Polarity Dataset. The model is built with PyTorch Lightning and classifies text as positive or negative without requiring language-specific fine-tuning.
